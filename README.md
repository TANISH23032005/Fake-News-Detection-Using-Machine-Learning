# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, I built a Fake News Detection model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithm. The model was trained on a dataset of real and fake news articles using TF-IDF vectorization to extract key features from the text.
