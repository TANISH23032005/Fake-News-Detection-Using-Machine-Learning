# Fake News Detection

This project is a simple machine learning solution for detecting fake news using text classification. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** to determine whether a news article is **fake (1)** or **real (0)**.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Build and train a machine learning model to classify news as fake or real.
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Text Processing**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- **Output File**: `model.pkl` â€“ the trained model you can load later for predictions.

## Dataset

A basic dataset with labeled examples is used for this demo. You can later replace this with a larger dataset from platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data).

| Text                                                         | Label |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| "NASA confirms water on the moon."                           |   0   |
| "The earth is flat and NASA lies."                           |   1   |
| "COVID-19 vaccines are effective."                           |   0   |
| "Aliens secretly run the government."                        |   1   |
